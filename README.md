# bleep-function
This programming challenge takes any word and phrase from user, then stars out the word when it appears in the phrase

Here I pass the text by reference, then in the function change the string to all lowercase. That is the one issue if the user would want to call the origional text again.
That problem can be solved by deleting the reference.  I did this as a problem origionally to show the use of passing by reference, which doesn't really pose a large problem for a small program.
